I am a Research Data Scientist at Meta, working on privacy and infrastructure related problems. I received my PhD from the University of California Los Angeles in the Statistics department. During my PhD I worked on social network modelling with <a href ="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~handcock/">Professor Mark Handcock</a>.
In particular I am interested in network generation processes, Bayesian social network models, causal inference for social networks and spatial point process models. Please take a look at my <a href ="https://duncan-clark.github.io/research/">research</a> page for publications and working papers. In general I am interested in using statistical models to understand complex social processes, and if modeling these more precisely and unambigously can lead to better interpretation of complex social problems.

I am originally from the UK and after finishing a masters in Mathematics I trained to be a pensions actuary for two years,
which was great grounding in basic statistics and data analysis. I've now moved over the pond after finding that I prefered
tackling interesting data driven problems to calculating people's pensions. I have the privledge to spend my time understanding and explaining data to people and hope to make a career doing just that.

This website gives a couple of examples of small "for fun" projects, as well as a brief description of my current academic research, my resume is available also.

I spend most my free time riding bicycles, sometimes I chase other people riding bicycles in circles too. I like baking cakes and bad sourdough, during the pandemic I slowly transformed my fridge in into a homemade cheese cave.
Feel free to contact me with any of the below methods, emails relating to cake, bicycles, and/or cheese may receive quicker replies.
